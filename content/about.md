_“I have not seen among people’s flaws anything as great as the shortcoming of those capable of perfection.”_ — **Al-Mutanabbi**


# About me
I’m a data scientist who loves **turning messy data into meaningful decisions**. Over the past decade, I’ve built pipelines, models, and stories that help people and products move smarter from early dashboards to machine learning systems that run at scale.

I believe **great data work isn’t just about accuracy; it’s about clarity**. I care about making insights _approachable_, models _explainable_, and systems _scalable_. I enjoy that sweet spot where business meets algorithms, where human intuition still guides the math.

Currently, I’m pursuing my **Master’s in Applied Data Science** at _Utrecht University_
