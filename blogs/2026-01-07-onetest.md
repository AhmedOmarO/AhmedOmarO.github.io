Reading “There Is Only One Test!” alongside Chapter 9 of Mathematical Statistics and Data Analysis really helped clarify things for me. Downey’s claim that all hypothesis tests ask the same core question—how surprising the data are under the null—matches exactly what Rice is formalizing with likelihood ratio tests, goodness-of-fit tests, and the test–confidence interval duality. Downey gives the intuition in plain language; Rice supplies the mathematical justification. Together, they make hypothesis testing feel like one coherent idea rather than a collection of disconnected procedures.
