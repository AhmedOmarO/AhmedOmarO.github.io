# Keeping Things Clear qadsadas

My old portfolio was full of animations and overlapping sections. It looked impressive, but it distracted from what mattered most: the work itself.

Here is what I focused on while rebuilding the site:

- Keep navigation straightforward with only two destinations.
- Choose typography and spacing that makes longer reads comfortable.
- Ensure new posts can be published with a simple Markdown file.

The result is a calmer, faster loading site where the content sets the tone.
