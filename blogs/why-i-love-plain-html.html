<h1>Why I Love Plain HTML</h1>
<p>
    HTML is still my favourite way to share an idea quickly. I can sketch a layout, publish a note,
    or test a concept without waiting for a build step.

<h2>Less tooling, more writing</h2>
<p>
    When I write in HTML the browser shows me exactly what I created. That immediacy keeps me focused
    on the story instead of the stack.
</p>
<h2>Great with Markdown</h2>
<p>
    Some posts start as Markdown in my notes app. When I'm ready, I polish the structure with HTML and
    ship it as-is. Now this site supports both so I can choose what fits the moment.
