# Building Smaller, Better Tools

Shipping a small tool often teaches me more than planning a large one. The scope is friendly,
feedback loops are faster, and I can see if the idea actually helps someone.

## What "small" means to me

- A problem I can describe in a sentence
- A solution that fits in a single repository
- A user interface that a friend can understand without a tour

Keeping the scope in check forces me to make clear trade-offs. Each version gets a little sharper.

## Why it works

Small tools invite experimentation. If something breaks, I can fix it before the coffee cools.
If it succeeds, I can grow it thoughtfully instead of scrambling to keep up.

When I start something new I now ask, *could this be smaller?* Most times, the answer is yes.
