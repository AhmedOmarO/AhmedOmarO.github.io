Jan 7th 2026

Reading Allen Downey’s “There Is Only One Test!” while studying Chapter 9 of Mathematical Statistics and Data Analysis really helped things click for me. Downey’s point that all hypothesis tests reduce to the same core question—how surprising is the data under the null?—is exactly what Rice is formalizing throughout the chapter. Likelihood ratio tests, goodness-of-fit tests, and even the link to confidence intervals all feel like different mathematical expressions of that single idea. Downey strips the concept down to intuition and simulation; Rice builds it back up with rigor and theory. Seeing them together makes the chapter feel less like a collection of separate tests and more like one coherent framework.
